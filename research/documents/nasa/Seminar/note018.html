Three spectral images of the same coordinates at the same time.  Histogram normalized for viewing.  These pictures are of a subvisual contrail.
</UL><UL>
Left:
</UL><UL>
0.66um channel.  Typical for many satellites and commonly used today for land surface classifications.  Not visible.
</UL><UL>
Right:
</UL><UL>
11um channel.  Dark is cold, light is warm.  You can see the contrail, but it would be difficult to fully define its extent without the middle panel.
</UL><UL>
Middle:
</UL><UL>
1.88um channel.  Near a strong water vapor absorption band, and, during the day, is extremely sensitive to the presence of high level clouds.

Used together, we can get a decent cloud mask.</UL> </P>
