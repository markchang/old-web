The Level 1B product generation was selected for implementation on the FPGA reconfigurable computer. Its data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for all spectral bands plus additional data including quality flags, error estimates and on-board calibration data. The Level 1B data is the input "fuel" used to generate every remaining MODIS product - it is "plugged in" to theoretical models that use radiance as a starting point to make useful statements concerning atmospheric and geophysical properties.

Uses the above viewports to define dynamic calibration values to be applied to the digital data stream.

SD: Near north pole it opens and views the sun for 2 minutes to track the radiance calibration stability of the reflected solar bands.
</UL><UL>
SRCA: Track changes in radiometric calibration.  Find limits of changes to responsivity, find center wavelengths, track along-scan shift in Earth location for each detector and each band.  3 modes of operation: spectral, radiometric, spatial.  Spatial: scan-shift tracked by reticules (fixed points).  Radiometric: uses lamps to calibrate reference levels.
</UL><UL>
BB: Isothermal w.r.t. scan cavity.  Used in emissive bands to get “zero”.
</UL><UL>
SV: Looks at cold space to determine “black”.  Used to establish gain and zero offset.  Occasionally looks at the moon as a radiance source.
