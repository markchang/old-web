On board local memory is organized into two banks.  Each bank is 512K x 8 SRAMs  Each bank can be accessed from either the PCI interface or the RPU. Mode 1-PCI to 32 bit RAM
</UL><UL>
Single or Burst 32-bit read or write to local memory from the PCI.  One address to both banks of memory.
</UL><UL>
Mode 2-PCI to RPU, RPU to 32 bit RAM
</UL><UL>
32-bit read or write to local memory from RPU
</UL><UL>
One address to both banks of memory
</UL><UL>
Concurrent PCI and local memory accesses
</UL><UL>
Can reconfigure logic in RPU while still processing data from local memories
</UL><UL>
Can store data into RPU registers and access data from local memories
</UL><UL>
Mode 3a & 3b PCI & RPU to 16 bit RAM
</UL><UL>
One bank of memory can be filled by the PCI interface and the other bank can be read from the RPU so that: Real time image processing
</UL><UL>
Mode 4 16 bit RAM to RPU to 16 bit RAM
</UL><UL>
Read or Write both banks simultaneously, 2 addresses, only communication to RPU through interrupts
