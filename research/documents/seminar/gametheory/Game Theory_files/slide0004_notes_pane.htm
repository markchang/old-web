Each has to choose whether or not to confess and implicate the  other. If neither man confesses, then both will serve one year on a charge of  carrying a concealed weapon. If each confesses and implicates the other, both  will go to prison for 10 years. However, if one burglar confesses and  implicates the other, and the other burglar does not confess, the one who has  collaborated with the police will go free, while the other burglar will go to  prison for 20 years on the maximum charge.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The strategies  in this case are: confess or don't confess. The payoffs (penalties, actually)  are the sentences served. We can express all this compactly in a &quot;payoff  table&quot; of a kind that has become pretty standard in game theory.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The table is  read like this: Each prisoner chooses one of the two strategies. In effect,  Al chooses a column and Bob chooses a row. The two numbers in each cell tell  the outcomes for the two prisoners when the corresponding pair of strategies  is chosen. The number to the left of the comma tells the payoff to the person  who chooses the rows (Bob) while the number to the right of the column tells  the payoff to the person who chooses the columns (Al).</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Thus (reading  down the first column) if they both confess, each gets 10 years, but if Al  confesses and Bob does not, Bob gets 20 and Al goes free.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>So: how to solve  this game? What strategies are &quot;rational&quot; if both men want to  minimize the time they spend in jail? Al might reason as follows: &quot;Two  things can happen: Bob can confess or Bob can keep quiet. Suppose Bob  confesses. Then I get 20 years if I don't confess, 10 years if I do, so in  that case it's best to confess. On the other hand, if Bob doesn't confess,  and I don't either, I get a year; but in that case, if I confess I can go  free. Either way, it's best if I confess. Therefore, I'll confess.Ò</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>But Bob can and  presumably will reason in the same way -- so that they both confess and go to  prison for 10 years each. Yet, if they had acted &quot;irrationally,&quot;  and kept quiet, they each could have gotten off with one year each.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
