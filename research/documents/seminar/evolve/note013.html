  <P> <UL>
Probing:
</UL><UL>
Want to see what is going on inside the circuit.  Can disrupt operation.
</UL><UL>
Simulation:
</UL><UL>
Can possibly isolate the extent of the dependence upon real hardware.
</UL><UL>
Synthesis:
</UL><UL>
Implement in different medium (discrete chips).  Easy access to probe internal signals and can determine what aspects of the hardware is necessary for operation.
</UL><UL>
Electromagnetic emissions:
</UL><UL>
Use radio receivers to detect circuit activity and roughly characterize it.
</UL><UL>
Evolutionary history:
</UL><UL>
The mechanisms used to solve the task may be more apparent in early evolutionary stages.  Maybe we can identify the innovations used to create offspring that perform the task and relate this to the operation of the circuit.
</UL><UL>
Population diversity:
</UL><UL>
Slightly different forms of high-fitness circuits can help reveal what basic mechanisms are used to solve the task.</UL> </P>
