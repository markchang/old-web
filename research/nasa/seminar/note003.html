Level 0: Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument payload data at full resolution; any and all communications artifacts, e.g., synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data removed.
</UL><UL>
Level 1A: Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters, e.g., platform ephemeris, compute and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data.
</UL><UL>
Level 1B: Level 1A data that has been processed to sensor units (not all instruments will have a Level 1B equivalent).  Takes calibration coefficients and recalculates the digital data payload to get at-aperture measurements.  Also could include ancillary data, e.g., quality flags, error estimates, and on-board calibration data.
</UL><UL>
Level 2: Derived geophysical variables at the same resolution and location as the Level 1 source data.
</UL><UL>
Level 3: Variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales, usually with some completeness and consistency.
</UL><UL>
Level 4: Model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple measurements.</UL> </P>
