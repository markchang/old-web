      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
	My research interests while at Olin are primarily motivated by
	my ability to involve undergraduates. Giving students direct
	research experience and an avenue to pursue their own
	out-of-classroom aspirations is what research at an
	undergraduate institutions means to me. Luckily, I have found
	synergies between student interests at Olin and things that
	are personally intellectually interesting.
      </p>

      <h1>Areas of interest</h1>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Mobile, Social, and Ubiquitous Computing</h2>
      <p>
	With the increasing adoption of "smart" mobile devices such as
	the iPhone, Android-powered devices, and others, the level of
	of computational capacity and device availability is making
	computing truly more ubiquitous. I am interested in both the
	educational aspects of mobile devices, and the research
	potential they provide for the fields of ubiquitous computing
	and human-computer interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
	I have been fortunate enough to teach a <a
	href="http://mobdev.olin.edu/" >class in Mobile Application
	Development</a> that is a synthesis of many experiences at
	Olin, including Entrepreneurship, Design, and
	Engineering. With industry collaboration, I believe these
	types of courses provide a unique opportunity for our students
	to experience how the curriculum we have surrounded them with
	gives them the tools to provide compelling user experiences on
	mobile devices.
      </p>

      <p>
	I am also interested in the intersection of mobile and
	ubiquitous computing and social media and communication. How
	ubiquity and its properties of location-awareness,
	computational horsepower, persistent-connectedness, and
	constant low-degree interruption mediates and changes
	communication habits between users.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	&nbsp;
      </p>
      

      <h2>Reconfigurable Computing</h2>

      <p>
        My interest in reconfigurable computing focuses on FPGAs
        (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), which are hardware devices
        that can be programmed to implement almost any complex digital
        circuit. In concert with student researchers, we have looked
        at how to use reconfigurable computing within areas of stereo
        vision, robotics, high-performance embedded computing, and
        engineering education.
      </p>

      <p>
	&nbsp;
      </p>

      <h2>Engineering Education</h2>

      <p>
	I have been fortunate to have some publications and experience
	in the area of engineering education. Currently, I am working
	with Google on
	the <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/08/under-hood-of-app-inventor-for-android.html">Google
	App Inventor for Android project.</a>. Working with Lynn Stein
	and Mark Sheldon here at Olin, we hope to better understand
	the unique challenges of introducing computer science and
	programming to first year students within an engineering context.
